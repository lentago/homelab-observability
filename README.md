# Homelab Observability

**Authorship:** The Terraform, Alloy config, dashboards, scripts, and documentation in this repo are co-written with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic). I direct the work and review the output; Claude writes the code. I'm an infrastructure operator, not a software engineer — please don't read this repo as a portfolio of coding ability.

**Agents / contributors:** setup, architecture, and credentials are documented here. Conventions (LogQL, dashboard UIDs, `node_exporter` model, kiosk) are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); PR norms in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Git-driven observability for a Firewalla home network, powered by [Grafana
Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) (free tier) on the visualization
side and a single [Grafana Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/) container on
the ingestion side.

Everything is declarative:

- Dashboards live as JSON in [`dashboards/`](dashboards/).
- Cloud-side resources (folders, dashboards, future alerts) are managed by
  [Terraform](terraform/) with the [`grafana/grafana`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest) provider.
- LXC-side ingestion is a single declarative [`alloy/config.alloy`](alloy/config.alloy)
  spun up by `docker compose`.

## First-time setup

### 1. Grafana Cloud credentials

- **Stack service account** (drives Terraform + future CLI tooling). In
  `https://pitzilabs.grafana.net` → **Administration → Users and access → Service
  accounts**, create a service account named `terraform-iac` with role **Admin**,
  then **Add token** and copy the value. This becomes `GRAFANA_AUTH`.
- **Access policy tokens** (drive Alloy remote_write / log push). At
  `https://grafana.com` → **My Account → Access Policies**, create one policy
  with scopes **`metrics:write`** and **`logs:write`** for the `pitzilabs` stack.
  Generate a token; copy the **username** (a numeric stack ID per signal type)
  and **token** and the **push URLs** from the stack details page.

Drop all of the above into `.envrc`:

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
$EDITOR .envrc           # fill in real values
direnv allow
```

### 2. Terraform — adopt Cloud-side resources

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan           # should show: import folder + 5 dashboards, then update them
terraform apply
```

After `apply`, back up `terraform/terraform.tfstate` to the NAS — it is not
committed to git (see [terraform/README.md](terraform/README.md) for the
rationale and recovery procedure).

The first apply rewrites datasource UIDs in each dashboard from `loki` /
`prometheus` (the old self-hosted UIDs) to `grafanacloud-pitzilabs-logs` /
`grafanacloud-pitzilabs-prom` (the pitzilabs stack's auto-provisioned UIDs).
The original JSON files in `dashboards/` are not modified — the rewrite happens
in-memory at apply time via `replace()` in `terraform/locals.tf`.

### 3. Delete orphan datasources in Cloud

The Cloud migration wizard created `loki` and `prometheus` datasources pointing
at the self-hosted LXC, which Grafana Cloud cannot reach. After `terraform
apply` repoints dashboards to `grafanacloud-*`, delete the orphans:

```bash
for uid in loki prometheus; do
  curl -sS -X DELETE \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAFANA_AUTH" \
    "$GRAFANA_URL/api/datasources/uid/$uid"
done
```

### 4. Alloy on the Proxmox LXC

```bash
# On the LXC (or any host with docker), in this repo:
cp alloy/ha_token.example alloy/ha_token
$EDITOR alloy/ha_token             # paste your HA long-lived access token
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f alloy       # confirm "remote_write succeeded" etc.
open http://<lxc-ip>:12345         # Alloy debug UI
```

After Alloy is up:

- Confirm logs arrive in Cloud: **Explore → grafanacloud-pitzilabs-logs** → `{cluster="homelab"}`.
- Confirm metrics arrive: **Explore → grafanacloud-pitzilabs-prom** →
  `up{cluster="homelab"}` should return 1 for each scrape target.
- Visit a dashboard (e.g. **Firewalla / Network Overview**) and confirm panels
  render data.

### 5. Office display (kiosk)

Grafana Cloud doesn't allow anonymous viewers. Use **public dashboard sharing**:

1. Open `firewalla-office-display` in the Cloud UI.
2. **Share → Public dashboard → Enable**.
3. Copy the public URL and point the kiosk Chromium at it.

The public URL bypasses auth for that one dashboard only; nothing else in the
stack is exposed.

### 6. CI

Add **repository** secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → **Actions**,
not Dependabot) so the `terraform plan` job can authenticate to Grafana:

- `GRAFANA_URL` — full stack URL, e.g. `https://pitzilabs.grafana.net` (no
  trailing slash).
- `GRAFANA_AUTH` — the same Grafana Cloud **service account token** you use in
  `.envrc` as `GRAFANA_AUTH` / `GRAFANA_SA_TOKEN`.

Both must be non-empty. If either is missing, the plan job fails immediately
with a clear log message instead of a misleading Terraform provider error.

GitHub Actions runs `terraform fmt -check`, `validate`, and `plan` on every PR
that touches `terraform/**` or `dashboards/**`, and posts the plan as a PR
comment. Applies stay local.

## Day-to-day

### Edit a dashboard

1. Edit the JSON file in `dashboards/` (or edit in the Cloud UI and copy the
   exported JSON back into the file).
2. `cd terraform && terraform plan` → review diff → `terraform apply`.
3. Back up `terraform.tfstate` to the NAS.

### Add a new dashboard

1. Drop a new JSON file in `dashboards/`.
2. Add an entry to the `firewalla_dashboards` local in
   [`terraform/locals.tf`](terraform/locals.tf).
3. `terraform apply`.

### Add new scrape targets / new log sources

Edit [`alloy/config.alloy`](alloy/config.alloy) and `docker compose up -d` (Alloy
hot-reloads on file change). No service restart needed.

### node_exporter

Bare-metal node_exporter on Proxmox hosts is unchanged. Run
`scripts/deploy-node-exporter.sh` against any new Proxmox host you add and
update the `prometheus.scrape "node"` target list in
[`alloy/config.alloy`](alloy/config.alloy).

## Why this layout

The original incarnation of this repo ran Loki, Prometheus, Grafana, and
blackbox-exporter all on a single LXC via `docker compose`, with file-based
provisioning. That worked but had three pain points:

1. **Storage on the LXC** — Prometheus TSDB + Loki chunks meant disk pressure
   and another thing to monitor.
2. **Dashboards drifted between repo and UI** — anything edited in the UI was
   lost on the next provisioner reload.
3. **No upgrade story** for Grafana itself — each `docker compose pull` was a
   gamble.

Migrating to Grafana Cloud free tier + Alloy fixes all three: storage moves to
the Cloud's free 50GB logs / 10K active series allotment; Terraform plus
checked-in dashboard JSON makes the repo the source of truth (UI edits get
overwritten on next apply); and Cloud handles Grafana upgrades.
