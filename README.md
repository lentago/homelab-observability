[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/lentago/drosera)

**Drosera** (sundew — the botanical codename line alongside `lentago`,
`solidago`, and `kalmia`) is the Lentago Labs observability suite. Today it
watches the Lentago lab; it will shortly extend to receive AWS telemetry from the
Lentago cloud estate. Renamed from `homelab-observability` on 2026-07-04 —
AWS-side resource names (the OIDC CI role, the Terraform state key) keep the
old prefix, as do the live `/opt/homelab-observability` checkouts on hosts.

**Authorship:** The Terraform, Alloy config, dashboards, scripts, and documentation in this repo are co-written with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic). I direct the work and review the output; Claude writes the code. I'm an infrastructure operator, not a software engineer — please don't read this repo as a portfolio of coding ability.

**Agents / contributors:** setup, architecture, and credentials are documented here. Conventions (LogQL, dashboard UIDs, `node_exporter` model, kiosk) are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); PR norms in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Git-driven observability for a Firewalla home network, powered by [Grafana
Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) (free tier) on the visualization
side and a single [Grafana Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/) container on
the ingestion side.

Everything is declarative:

- Dashboards live as JSON in [`dashboards/`](dashboards/).
- Cloud-side resources (folders, dashboards, future alerts) are managed by
  [Terraform](terraform/) with the [`grafana/grafana`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest) provider.
- LXC-side ingestion is a single declarative [`alloy/config.alloy`](alloy/config.alloy)
  spun up by `docker compose`.

## Architecture

Node metrics **push** from each host (host-local Alloy → Mimir, 15s); the
central Alloy on the LXC handles only blackbox probes, the Home Assistant
scrape, and the Loki receiver. **Full rendered diagram, paths, and label
conventions: [docs/metrics-flow.md](docs/metrics-flow.md).**

## Loki output contract

Firewalla ships logs to Alloy via a Promtail-compatible push endpoint at
**`192.168.139.20:3100`** (`/loki/api/v1/push`). Alloy forwards every stream to
Grafana Cloud Loki under the `cluster="lentago-lab"` external label, which it
injects automatically — queries may filter on it or omit it.

The four active log streams, keyed by `log_source`:

| `log_source` | Contents |
|---|---|
| `zeek_dns` | DNS query/response records from Zeek — domain, query type, client IP, answer. |
| `zeek_conn` | TCP/UDP connection summaries — src/dst IP and port, bytes, duration, state. |
| `zeek_ssl` | TLS handshake records — SNI, certificate subject, cipher, validation status. |
| `firewalla_acl` | Firewalla ACL alarm events — blocked/allowed flows, rule name, severity. |

**Change coordination:** the Firewalla side of this pipeline lives in
[lentago/betula](https://github.com/lentago/betula) (renamed from
`firewalla-axiom-pipeline` 2026-07-04).
Any change to the `log_source` values or the push endpoint above must be
coordinated with that repo (see its issue #42, which shipped the current label
scheme) so both sides stay in sync.

## Solidago (AWS) contract

Solidago platform metrics render in this stack via a **query-on-demand
CloudWatch datasource** — nothing is streamed or imported into Mimir, so it
consumes zero free-tier active series. Queries bill as CloudWatch
`GetMetricData` at render time; the dashboard refresh floor is **1m**.

- **This repo owns:** the `Solidago` folder, the `solidago-cloudwatch`
  datasource (`terraform/datasources.tf`, "Grafana Assume Role" auth), and
  Solidago dashboards (`dashboards/solidago-platform-health.json`).
- **[lentago/solidago](https://github.com/lentago/solidago) owns:** the IAM
  role `solidago-dev-grafana-cloudwatch` (`modules/grafana-cloud`), its trust
  and permission policies, and the External ID plumbing.
- **Coordination rule:** renaming the role, changing auth, or widening its
  policy is a **cross-repo change** — same discipline as the `log_source`
  label contract above.
- **Overnight gaps are the DR drill, not an outage:** solidago tears down and
  rebuilds nightly; role ARNs are deterministic, so the datasource never needs
  re-pointing, and "No data" while the platform is down is correct behavior.
- **Alerting stays AWS-native** (CloudWatch alarms → SNS; solidago ADR-0001) —
  Grafana is visualization only.
- **Known health-check quirk:** the datasource's Save & test / health endpoint
  probes CloudWatch **Logs** as well as metrics, so it reports
  `AccessDeniedException … logs:DescribeLogGroups` alongside "Successfully
  queried the CloudWatch metrics API". That is **expected, not a fault** — the
  role is metrics-only by design (logs belong to Axiom/betula, per ADR-0001's
  boundary). Metrics green = healthy. Verified end-to-end 2026-07-04
  (assume-role query returned live ALB series for all three target groups).

## First-time setup

### 1. Grafana Cloud credentials

- **Stack service account** (drives Terraform + future CLI tooling). In
  `https://lentago.grafana.net` → **Administration → Users and access → Service
  accounts**, create a service account named `terraform-iac` with role **Admin**,
  then **Add token** and copy the value. This becomes `GRAFANA_AUTH`.
- **Access policy tokens** (drive Alloy remote_write / log push). At
  `https://grafana.com` → **My Account → Access Policies**, create one policy
  with scopes **`metrics:write`** and **`logs:write`** for the `lentago` stack.
  Generate a token; copy the **username** (a numeric stack ID per signal type)
  and **token** and the **push URLs** from the stack details page.

Drop all of the above into `.envrc`:

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
$EDITOR .envrc           # fill in real values
direnv allow
```

### 2. Terraform — adopt Cloud-side resources

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan           # should show: import folder + 5 dashboards, then update them
terraform apply
```

State lives in S3 (solidago's `foundry-tfstate-365184644049` bucket, versioned +
encrypted) — no local-state backup step needed. Day to day you don't run `apply`
by hand at all: **merging dashboard/terraform changes to `main` auto-applies** via
the `terraform` workflow. See [terraform/README.md](terraform/README.md) § State and
§ CI.

The first apply rewrites datasource UIDs in each dashboard from `loki` /
`prometheus` (the old self-hosted UIDs) to `grafanacloud-lentago-logs` /
`grafanacloud-lentago-prom` (the lentago stack's auto-provisioned UIDs).
The original JSON files in `dashboards/` are not modified — the rewrite happens
in-memory at apply time via `replace()` in `terraform/locals.tf`.

### 3. Delete orphan datasources in Cloud

The Cloud migration wizard created `loki` and `prometheus` datasources pointing
at the self-hosted LXC, which Grafana Cloud cannot reach. After `terraform
apply` repoints dashboards to `grafanacloud-*`, delete the orphans:

```bash
for uid in loki prometheus; do
  curl -sS -X DELETE \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAFANA_AUTH" \
    "$GRAFANA_URL/api/datasources/uid/$uid"
done
```

### 4. Alloy on the Proxmox LXC

```bash
# On the LXC (or any host with docker), in this repo:
cp alloy/ha_token.example alloy/ha_token
$EDITOR alloy/ha_token             # paste your HA long-lived access token (no trailing newline — use printf '%s' "<token>" > alloy/ha_token to be safe)
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f alloy       # confirm "remote_write succeeded" etc.
open http://<lxc-ip>:12345         # Alloy debug UI
```

After Alloy is up:

- Confirm logs arrive in Cloud: **Explore → grafanacloud-lentago-logs** → `{cluster="lentago-lab"}`.
- Confirm metrics arrive: **Explore → grafanacloud-lentago-prom** →
  `up{cluster="lentago-lab"}` should return 1 for each scrape target.
- Visit a dashboard (e.g. **Firewalla / Network Overview**) and confirm panels
  render data.

### 5. Office display (kiosk)

Grafana Cloud doesn't allow anonymous viewers. Use **public dashboard sharing**:

1. Open `firewalla-office-display` in the Cloud UI.
2. **Share → Public dashboard → Enable**.
3. Copy the public URL and point the kiosk Chromium at it.

The public URL bypasses auth for that one dashboard only; nothing else in the
stack is exposed.

### 6. CI

Add **repository** secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → **Actions**,
not Dependabot) so the `plan` and `apply` jobs can authenticate to Grafana:

- `GRAFANA_URL` — full stack URL, e.g. `https://lentago.grafana.net` (no
  trailing slash).
- `GRAFANA_AUTH` — the same Grafana Cloud **service account token** you use in
  `.envrc` as `GRAFANA_AUTH` / `GRAFANA_SA_TOKEN`.

Both must be non-empty. If either is missing, the job fails immediately with a
clear log message instead of a misleading Terraform provider error.

AWS (for the S3 state backend) is reached via GitHub **OIDC** — no AWS secrets are
stored; the jobs assume `homelab-observability-github-actions-terraform` in account
`365184644049`. The workflow runs `fmt -check` + `validate` + `plan` (posted as a PR
comment) on every PR touching `terraform/**` or `dashboards/**`, and **`apply
-auto-approve` on push to `main`** — so merges deploy automatically. See
[terraform/README.md](terraform/README.md) § CI.

## Day-to-day

### Edit a dashboard

1. Edit the JSON file in `dashboards/` (or edit in the Cloud UI and copy the
   exported JSON back into the file).
2. Open a PR — CI posts the `terraform plan` as a comment. **Merging to `main`
   auto-applies.** (Out-of-band you can still `cd terraform && terraform apply`.)

### Add a new dashboard

1. Drop a new JSON file in `dashboards/`.
2. Add an entry to the `firewalla_dashboards` local in
   [`terraform/locals.tf`](terraform/locals.tf).
3. Open a PR; merging to `main` applies it (or `terraform apply` locally).

### Add new scrape targets / new log sources

Edit [`alloy/config.alloy`](alloy/config.alloy), open a PR, merge. The central
Alloy on the grafana-stack LXC is **gitops-managed**: `alloy-gitops.timer`
pulls `origin/main` every 5 minutes, validates with `alloy fmt`, and reloads the
collector on drift (`SIGHUP` for `alloy/` changes, `docker compose up -d` for
compose changes). No hand-editing on the LXC — see
[`alloy-host/README.md`](alloy-host/README.md). To deploy immediately instead of
waiting for the timer: `systemctl start alloy-gitops.service` on the LXC.

### node_exporter

Bare-metal node_exporter on each host is the metric source. Run
`scripts/deploy-node-exporter.sh` against any new host you add. How those
metrics reach Grafana Cloud depends on the collection model below.

### Collection models: central pull vs. host-local push

There are two ways a host's node_exporter metrics get to Mimir, and the repo
supports both side by side with identical labels (`job="node"`,
`instance="<host>"`), so dashboards never care which is in use:

- **Central pull (default/legacy):** the Alloy on LXC 105 scrapes the host's
  `:9100` over the LAN. Add the host to the `prometheus.scrape "node"` target
  list in [`alloy/config.alloy`](alloy/config.alloy).
- **Host-local push (standardized):** the host runs its own Alloy that scrapes
  `localhost:9100` and `remote_write`s to Mimir at 15s. Tighter cadence,
  buffers across network blips, and each host owns its own shipping. Deploy
  with [`scripts/deploy-alloy.sh`](scripts/deploy-alloy.sh):

  ```bash
  source .envrc                     # exports GRAFANA_CLOUD_METRICS_*
  # on the target host (root, or via sudo):
  ./deploy-alloy.sh <instance-label>   # e.g. neptune, pve, pve3
  ```

  The script installs Alloy from the Grafana apt repo, writes
  `/etc/alloy/config.alloy` (canonical config embedded in the script) and a
  `0600 /etc/default/alloy` holding the push token, then enables the service.

**Don't run both for the same host** — that double-counts series. When you move
a host to push, delete it from the central `prometheus.scrape "node"` block.
The rollout target is neptune + all five Proxmox nodes on push; HAOS stays on
the central HA `/api/prometheus` scrape (it can't run a system Alloy).

### Fleet reasoning stream (worker transcripts)

The **Claude Runner Fleet** dashboard has a live *"Fleet stream of
consciousness"* panel that shows each running bullpen job's reasoning in
near-real-time (each assistant turn's narration + the tools it fired). The
source is a **worker-local Alloy agent** on each runner that tails Claude
Code's session transcript as it is written and ships it to Grafana Cloud Loki
as `job="claude_transcript"` (labels: `project`, `worker`, `session_id`).

Deploy it per worker with
[`scripts/deploy-runner-transcript-alloy.sh`](scripts/deploy-runner-transcript-alloy.sh)
(canonical config: [`alloy/runner-transcript.alloy`](alloy/runner-transcript.alloy)):

```bash
source .envrc   # exports GRAFANA_CLOUD_LOGS_*
# on the worker (sudo-capable), from a repo checkout:
./scripts/deploy-runner-transcript-alloy.sh   # worker label is auto (from hostname)
```

It runs as a dedicated `alloy-transcript.service` under the `claude` user (the
session files are `0600 claude:claude`). **Egress is deliberately scrubbed**
(see [#71](https://github.com/lentago/drosera/issues/71)): only
`assistant` text + tool *names* are shipped — `thinking` blocks, tool *inputs*,
and `user`/tool-result lines (raw repo contents) never leave the LAN. A `runid`
label is a possible future bullpen-side fast-follow.

### Device inventory feed (name ↔ IP resolution)

Dashboards that show raw LAN source IPs (`id_orig_h`) resolve them to device
names by joining against a **device-inventory log stream**,
`log_source="device_inventory"`. Grafana Cloud runs queries server-side and
cannot reach the LAN, and LAN topology must not be published to GitHub — so the
name↔IP mapping travels the same trusted Alloy → Cloud Loki channel the Zeek
logs already use (see [#113](https://github.com/lentago/drosera/issues/113)).

The publisher
([`scripts/device-inventory-publisher/publish-device-inventory.sh`](scripts/device-inventory-publisher/publish-device-inventory.sh))
runs **on the Firewalla box** (pi user, **hourly** via cron). It reads the box's
own device inventory from local redis (`host:mac:*` hashes — no new
credentials) and pushes one record per (device, IP) pair to the central Alloy
Loki receiver (`http://<ALLOY_HOST>:3100/loki/api/v1/push`) — the same endpoint
the box already ships Zeek logs to.

**Stream schema** — one Loki stream per (device, IP):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| label `log_source` | `device_inventory` |
| label `dev` | `<name>\|<ip>` — **load-bearing** (see below) |
| line body (JSON) | `{"name":"…","ip":"…","mac":"…","family":"4"\|"6","source":"firewalla-redis"}` |

Display name is the redis `name` field, else `bname`, else the MAC. Both the
IPv4 (`ipv4Addr`) and every IPv6 (`ipv6Addr` array) address get their own row.

**The `dev` label contract:** the `<name>|<ip>` shape lets a dashboard build a
template variable with `label_values({log_source="device_inventory"}, dev)` and
regex `/(?<text>[^|]+)\|(?<value>.+)/` — the dropdown shows device *names* while
the variable value stays the raw IP that `id_orig_h=~"$device_ip"` needs. Any
`|` in a device name is stripped before composing the label so the split stays
unambiguous.

Deploy / update it by **re-running** the deploy script from the operator
workstation (it scp's the publisher, installs the pi cron entry, and installs a
`~/.firewalla/config/post_main.d/` hook that re-installs the cron after FireMain
regenerates state):

```bash
./scripts/deploy-device-inventory-publisher.sh <ALLOY_HOST>   # e.g. 192.168.139.20
# smoke-test on the box without pushing:
ssh pi@firewalla.local 'DRY_RUN=1 ~/.firewalla/run/device-inventory/publish-device-inventory.sh | head'
```

Like the worker transcript shipper, this publisher is **not gitops-managed** —
editing the script on `main` does not auto-deploy; you must re-run the deploy
script. Volume is negligible (~110 devices, hourly; logs not metrics, so it
does not touch the 15k active-series cap).

### Series budget / HA export trim

Grafana Cloud free tier caps **active series at 15,000**. Home Assistant's
`/api/prometheus` export is the single biggest consumer — it emits a series
for nearly every entity plus per-entity change-counters, "last updated"
timestamps, availability flags, and `*_created` markers. None of that is used
by any dashboard, so the `prometheus.relabel "ha_trim"` component in
[`alloy/config.alloy`](alloy/config.alloy) drops those families before
remote_write, reclaiming ~5.8k series. The real numeric HA metrics
(temperatures, fan RPM, battery, climate, brightness, sensor states) are kept.

Check current usage with the `grafanacloud-usage` datasource:
`grafanacloud_instance_active_series`. If you add a host (each node_exporter is
~1.3k series), watch the headroom — trim more (e.g. node_exporter discard/flush
families) or the rollout will hit `err-mimir-max-active-series`.

### Check Loki label health

`scripts/check-loki-labels.sh` queries Loki for active `log_source` values over
the last 24h and diffs against the expected set (`zeek_dns`, `zeek_conn`,
`zeek_ssl`, `firewalla_acl`).  Run it manually as a sanity check, or wire it to
a cron / GitHub Actions schedule to alert on silent log streams:

```bash
source .envrc
./scripts/check-loki-labels.sh
```

Exits 0 when all four values are present; exits 1 and prints the missing names to
stderr otherwise.

## Why this layout

The original incarnation of this repo ran Loki, Prometheus, Grafana, and
blackbox-exporter all on a single LXC via `docker compose`, with file-based
provisioning. That worked but had three pain points:

1. **Storage on the LXC** — Prometheus TSDB + Loki chunks meant disk pressure
   and another thing to monitor.
2. **Dashboards drifted between repo and UI** — anything edited in the UI was
   lost on the next provisioner reload.
3. **No upgrade story** for Grafana itself — each `docker compose pull` was a
   gamble.

Migrating to Grafana Cloud free tier + Alloy fixes all three: storage moves to
the Cloud's free 50GB logs / 10K active series allotment; Terraform plus
checked-in dashboard JSON makes the repo the source of truth (UI edits get
overwritten on next apply); and Cloud handles Grafana upgrades.
