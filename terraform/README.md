# Terraform — Grafana Cloud

Manages everything in the `lentago` Grafana Cloud stack as code: dashboards, folders,
data sources, contact points, notification policies, alert rules, and service accounts.

Dashboard JSON files live in [`../dashboards/`](../dashboards/) and are the source of truth.
Terraform rewrites the original self-hosted datasource UIDs (`loki`, `prometheus`) to the
Grafana Cloud UIDs (`grafanacloud-logs`, `grafanacloud-prom`) at apply time, so the JSON
files stay portable. Note these are the datasource **UIDs** (`grafanacloud-<service>`), not
their stack-prefixed **names** (`grafanacloud-lentago-{logs,prom}`) — panels reference
datasources by UID, so rewriting to the name produces a dangling ref that silently falls
back to the default datasource. The exact mapping lives in [`locals.tf`](locals.tf); verify
against a live stack with the `curl … /api/datasources | jq '.[]|{uid,name}'` snippet there.
Terraform reads them via `file()` and pushes them to Grafana Cloud — never the other way
around. Drift introduced via the Grafana UI gets overwritten on the next `apply`.

## State

Remote state in **S3** ([`backend.tf`](backend.tf)): solidago's state bucket
`solidago-tfstate-365184644049`, key `homelab-observability/terraform.tfstate`, region
`us-east-1`, with DynamoDB lock table `solidago-tfstate-lock`. The bucket is versioned +
encrypted, so the old "back up the local `tfstate` to the NAS" step is gone — S3 is the
single authoritative store shared by local runs and CI.

Local `terraform` uses your own AWS creds (the `default` profile / `cpitzi-iac` user); CI
assumes the `homelab-observability-github-actions-terraform` OIDC role (the role and state key keep the pre-rename `homelab-observability` prefix — the repo became `drosera` on 2026-07-04), scoped to **only**
this state key + the lock table — it cannot touch solidago's own state. (History: state was
laptop-local until 2026-06-19, migrated into S3 to enable apply-on-merge — see CI below.)

## Prerequisites

- Terraform `>= 1.5` (for `import` blocks)
- direnv loading `../.envrc` so `GRAFANA_URL` and `GRAFANA_AUTH` are in your shell
- Service account token in `GRAFANA_AUTH` with **Admin** role on the stack
- AWS creds in your shell (the `default` profile / `cpitzi-iac` user) with access to the S3
  state bucket + lock table — `terraform init`/`plan`/`apply` read & write remote state

## Day-to-day

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init           # one time, or after provider/backend changes
terraform plan           # show drift / pending changes
terraform apply          # apply locally — or just merge to main (see CI below)
```

## CI / apply-on-merge

The [`terraform` workflow](../.github/workflows/terraform.yml) runs on every PR and push
touching `terraform/**` or `dashboards/**`:

- **PR** → `validate` (fmt + validate) and `plan` (posts the diff as a PR comment).
- **push to `main`** → `validate` then **`apply -auto-approve`** — merging a dashboard
  change deploys it automatically; no manual `terraform apply` needed.

CI authenticates to Grafana via the `GRAFANA_URL` / `GRAFANA_AUTH` repo secrets, and to AWS
(for S3 state) via GitHub **OIDC**, assuming
`arn:aws:iam::365184644049:role/homelab-observability-github-actions-terraform` (least
privilege: this state key + the lock table only). The `apply` job uses a `terraform-apply`
concurrency group so two quick merges serialize instead of racing.

## Adopting a new resource that already exists in Cloud

1. Add an `import` block in `imports.tf`:

   ```hcl
   import {
     to = grafana_dashboard.my_new_dashboard
     id = "my-dashboard-uid"
   }
   ```

2. Add the matching `resource` definition in the appropriate `.tf` file.
3. Run `terraform plan` — it should show "1 to import, 0 to add" with no diff.
4. Run `terraform apply`.
5. (Optional) Remove the `import` block once the resource is in state.

## Creating a new dashboard from scratch

1. Drop a JSON file in `../dashboards/`.
2. Add an entry to the `firewalla_dashboards` map in [`locals.tf`](locals.tf) (the `grafana_dashboard` resource uses `for_each` over that map in [`dashboards.tf`](dashboards.tf)).
3. Add a matching `import` block in [`imports.tf`](imports.tf) if the dashboard was already created in the UI (otherwise Terraform creates it on first apply).
4. `terraform apply`.
