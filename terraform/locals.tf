  # Dashboard JSON in the repo references the original self-hosted datasource
  # UIDs ("loki" and "prometheus"). On Grafana Cloud the lentago stack
  # auto-provisions datasources whose *UID* is "grafanacloud-<service>"
  # (logs / prom / infinity). The stack-name prefix ("grafanacloud-lentago-*")
  # appears in the datasource *name*, NOT its UID — panels reference datasources
  # by UID, so we must rewrite to the UID, not the name. We rewrite at apply time
  # so the JSON files stay portable.
  #
  # To verify the UIDs on a live stack (note: read .uid, not .name):
  #   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAFANA_AUTH" $GRAFANA_URL/api/datasources \
  #     | jq '.[] | {uid, name}'
  #
  # History: loki/prometheus were previously rewritten to the *name*
  # ("grafanacloud-lentago-{logs,prom}"), which are non-existent UIDs. Prom
  # panels still rendered because the Prometheus datasource is the stack default,
  # so a dangling UID silently fell back to it; all-Loki dashboards (e.g.
  # claude-runner-fleet) showed "No data" because the fallback default is
  # Prometheus, which can't run LogQL. infinity was already correct.
